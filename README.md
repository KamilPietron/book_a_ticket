Small project that I have done during my university classes.
Web application that lets you book a ticket via booking form.

In "Rezerwacja" tab there is a booking form with a validation using HTML, JS and PHP.
When the form is successfully submited it is saved in the database made in posgreSQL.

In "Panel administracyjny" tab there are form submissions: id number of an order, clients name, email, quantity of tickets, date of session, type of ticket (student's ticket or regular one), comment (not required).
On the same tab there is an input where you can type the id number of the order, press the button and it will show you the full order of the chosen id number.
All of the order submissions are stored in the posgreSQL database.
